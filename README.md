#BootstrapVue Loader
A Webpack plugin for automatic importing BootstrapVue components and directives for treeshaking.

With this plugin help you can remove your global BootstrapVue import and forget about manually importing each component
for optimal bundle size. This plugin will do it for you!

This is some kind of VuetifyLoader fork, and I would like to thank that team for hard work.
